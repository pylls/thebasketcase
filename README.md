Tools for evaluating [basket2](https://git.schwanenlied.me/yawning/basket2)
padding modes. Part of the [HOT research project](http://www.cs.kau.se/pulls/hot/). Once we're happy with the
evaluation we'll move on to customizing one or more padding modes. Our goal is
to develop an efficient and practical padding mode to protect against
[website fingerprinting attacks](http://www.cs.kau.se/pulls/hot/setting/).
